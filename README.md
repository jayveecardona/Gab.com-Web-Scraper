# Gab.com Web Scraper

This Python script scrapes information from a Gab.ai user profile and saves the data to a CSV file. The script uses the selenium package to load the Gab.ai profile and scroll down to the bottom of the page, the BeautifulSoup package to parse the HTML of the loaded webpage, and the pandas package to save the extracted data into a CSV file.
